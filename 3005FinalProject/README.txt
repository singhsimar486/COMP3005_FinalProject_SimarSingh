Instructions: Please use Postgres for the creation of the database
            - As shown in the server.js the connection to the database from lines 12 - 19, please use your own information from the pg admin application to connect to the database.
            - Install all the dependencies needed for the web application. They are all stated in the video but I have also provided them here, Npm init, Npm install, npm install express, npm install pg. 
            - For testing, just input in the ddl.sql file content in the Postgres database to make the tables and then you can populate them after launching the web app.
